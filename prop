![teaser_mk_new.png](https://github.com/profishional/nmk_files/blob/main/teaser_mk_new.png?raw=true)

[Real design will be done by a top-tier designer once he can start on the project]

---

### Revisions from [#266](https://nouns.wtf/vote/266):

- USDC is denominated throughout the proposal and budget. Approximately 38% budget reduction by changing manufacturing approach, reducing marketing and team budget.
- Primarily manufacturing a Keycap set with an optional full keyboard. Also separating MK DAO and Physical NFT experiments for the next iteration.
- Simplified overall plan, shortened text, better Q&A, and detailed costing included at the end.

[**Positive feedback from the previous proposal**](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/266):

- Community Alignment: A shared belief that the mechanical keyboard and Nouns communities have synergies, both being passionate and vibrant.
- Artistic Value: Recognition that mechanical keyboards are not just tools but are viewed as curated works of art by enthusiasts.
- Detailed Proposal: Depth and informativeness of the proposal including the visual concepts. Also, confidence in the team's ability given their experiences.

---

---

### TL;DR:

- Nouns-themed keycap set by top-tier designer (not just glasses seen in the illustration) to introduce Nouns to an enthusiastic subculture of gamers, developers, collectors, and typists.
- 75K for 682 keycap sets or 273 full keyboards (keycap set + case), or a combination between those two limits. With 3 tiers of Artisan keycaps for marketing and low entry points.
- The grant covers all of the costs and Nouners mint for free. profit from non-Noun holder mints goes to the project treasury until they can afford to buy a Noun.

### Intro

As one of the primary means of interacting with our online world, keyboards are more than just a tool – they've become a piece of personal expression. Let's design a keyboard a Nouns-themed Mechanical Keyboard (MK) that the community appreciates! NextMech and I are excited to bring this project to Nouns in collaboration with top-tier keyboard designers. With our internal MK knowledge and technical ability we plan to introduce the MK community to Nouns.

### Overview

Over the years, [an online subculture has emerged (partial MK ecosystem stats)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) that cherishes their custom keyboards as works of art. The MK enthusiasts coordinate in a very similar way to NFT communities. For example, designers share their plans with collectors who pre-order their work to fund the manufacturing cost. Also, the communities of designers and their fans are decentralized across different platforms and websites. [They even have meetups around the world](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query)! So it’s possible to bring these two communities together over time and provide value to each other.

The community activity and other meetups can be seen by searching for ["mechanical keyboard meet"](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X or searching "[custom keyboard](https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=custom%20keyboards)” on Instagram. This culture also extends into the gaming/work setups online.

Also, looking at the r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit we see the community is slowly growing over time:

### Us

NextMech and I (profish) began working on a project called Mechies last year which won a small prize in an Aussie hackathon. We thought about MK NFTs in different forms such as generative art with manufacturable traits, DAOs as Vendors for group buys, hardware-embedded signatures, etc., to help improve the ecosystem. But at the beginning of the year, we learned about Nouns and it made sense as a good starting point to trial this community effort.

We devised a proposal in April ([prop #266](https://nouns.wtf/vote/266)) with an ambitious plan. We received feedback around details and project strategy, which we took on board for this revision. However, with the lack of certainty around Nouns forking events we held back until we understood what was happening, and found a better time for the team given other responsibilities we had. 

### Nouns x MKs

The proliferation can take immediate effect with current channels. For instance, the Nouns Esports team can incorporate keycaps into their gaming setup, showcasing to the gaming spectators. Nouns keycaps may serve as POAPs for crypto hackathon participants, while the full Nouns keyboards are taken to global meetups. Furthermore, images of these keyboards and keycaps will appear on popular online forums and social media accounts of MK enthusiasts - the design is not going to be as blatant as the example design, but rather more aesthetic and nuanced in the way it incorporates the Nouns theme. Also, we plan to work with MK builders and reviewers who have hundreds of thousands, even millions of followers to showcase the MK and the story of Nouns.

### Summary Plan

**Here is a simple cost breakdown. A more detailed breakdown is below:**

- 75K to manufacture a maximum of approximately 680 keycap sets, a maximum of 330 full keyboards, or some combination of the two depending on demand.
- 15K for assembling, packaging, storage, and decent-quality shipping.
- 29K for digital marketing and artisan keycap including low, medium, and high tier.
- 35K for the team, MK designer, website, and fulfillment.

**Total - 154K USD**

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **What will the design be**? NOT THE ONE YOU SEE. That is just to spark the imagination, the designer will come up with something much more aesthetic and subtle once we go through the brand brief.
- **Who is the designer**? They are one of the mentioned people below. Due to their high profile status in the MK community, we will not reveal their name until they see the support from Nouns and can begin working on it. I can assure you he is one of the best out there for this project.
- **Who is going to buy these**? NOT crypto people - ideally. The point isn’t to sell it to Nouns holders, it's to distribute it to the MK community to continue proliferating the idea. That's also why we are working with a designer the MK community respects.
- **How much are the NFTs?** Approximately 120-130 USD for the keycap set and 350-380 USD for the full keyboard option. Noun holders can purchase for free (within the budgeted units in the grant) while Non Noun holders will pay full price. We aim to distribute these
- **How does the redemption work?** Once you redeem, the NFT becomes non-transferable. Because sharing pictures of the keyboard is important and having an NFT is even better.
- **How are you going to sell to noncrypto people?** We aim to work with traditional distribution channels such as marketplaces and communities to reach the MK community. We are exploring solutions for wallet creation for the consumer at the purchase stage.
- **Why is it so expensive?** Custom mechanical keyboards by top-tier designers, with good quality switches, cases, and components can go around $500 USD. Given the interested designer and other components, this is a reasonable price.
- **How many units?** The free units for Noun holders would be a maximum of 682 keycaps or 328 full keyboards or a combination that totals a maximum of 75k worth of manufacturing. We plan to sell more units for a profit to non-Nouns holders.
- **Will the keyboards be assembled?** We have an assembled and un-assembled option for the minters since assembling is part of the custom MK experience for some collectors.
- **How long does it take to deliver?** Design could be done quickly but we want to give the designer 1-2 months. Manufacturing takes about 6 months. Delivery should take 2-3 weeks. So about 8 months, but assuming unforeseen challenges it may take 9-10 months from the time funds have been received.
- **What happens to the grant and mint profits?** The grant helps meet the Minimum Order Quantity for manufacturing which wouldn’t be possible otherwise. The profits from the Non-Nouns holders go to the team which we expect to be less than 20K USD.
- **Will anything be returned to the Nouns DAO?** Because we are MK enthusiasts we want this to become a reality, so have made the team portion of the grant very modest relative to the work it takes. But we are committed to using some of the profits to buy a Noun and participate in the community - this also incentivized Nouns to help the success of the project. We don’t think it’s Nounish to be underpaid, make direct payments to the DAO, and leave.
- **How big is the MK community?** The forums and Discord servers of designers are similar to or, bigger in size and activity compared to crypto communities. It is pretty scattered online, but I have made a [spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) to provide some context.
- **How will the project continue besides a one-off product?** We will plan an extension if this grant proves to be successful. It would involve creating a subDAO and experimenting with various products.

## Detailed Plan

Custom keyboard manufacturing involves two main components: the case and the keycap set. Switches and other components are also significant, but they are less customizable; therefore, we will simply use ones considered enthusiast grade. For a more detailed overview of mechanical keyboards, [check out this intro made by NextMech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing).

**Design -** To start, we will incorporate the Nouns brand into the keyboard canvas. We are considering a collaboration with several designers who can create an aesthetic Noun-themed keyboard. These include [BIIP](https://instagram.com/biipmk), [NoPunIn10Did](https://nopunin10did.com/kat-napoleonic/), [sourmk](https://www.instagram.com/sourmk), pikku-allu, dededecline who would be able to capture the essence of the Nouns in a design. Also, a design by a top artist plays a major role in introducing Nouns to the MK community, ensuring a high-quality product that enthusiasts will enjoy. Here are some examples by the mentioned designers:

**Manufacturing -** We will work with a manufacturer with double-shot ABS capability to be able to make high-quality keycaps. However, if the creative direction requires a custom font we may trade off double-shot quality for printing flexibility. As for the case, we will be using an available unit from existing manufacturer catalogs that matches the keycaps set. The remaining components will be wholesale units that are considered enthusiast-grade quality. 

**The NFT -** will include the custom design once the prototypes are finalized. Mint of keycaps will be priced at approximately $140 USD, while the full keyboard (including the keycaps) will be $350-380 USD. It will have boolean-based redemption on [nouns.mk](https://nouns.mk/) since we don't want to burn the NFT so that it can be shared online. We also aim to work with traditional distributors to be able to reach the MK community.

**Marketing -** Prior to, and during the minting of the Keyboard NFTs, we will launch digital and physical marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the project. The physical marketing is in the style of MK communities. We are considering 3 different types of artisan keycaps. The keycaps are, Resin filled 3D keycaps that could have Nouns characters or traits inside, high-quality metallic keycaps, and Plastic keycaps with Nouns related graphics that can be given away for free at crypto conferences and MK events, or for a low cost online.

Here are examples of existing Resin and metallic keycaps by artisans. They will be designed with Nouns related themes. These caps can be a great addition to the custom keyboard, or they allow MK enthusiasts to add it to their existing keyboards.

![metal_caps](https://github.com/profishional/nmk_files/blob/main/metal_cal.jpeg?raw=true)

**Delivery -** Once manufacturing, assembly, and quality tests are complete, the NFTs can be redeemed. They will be stored with a distributor or manufacturer and can be redeemed at any time. It is possible to sell the NFTs prior to redeeming them with a 5% royalty fee.

### **Current Progress**

We will keep up-to-date information and progress on our Notions page. Here are some highlights from the current progress:

- Determined feasible manufacturers for case and keycaps.
- Discussing terms with keycap set designer and singular keycap manufacturers.
- Registered [Nouns.mk](http://nouns.mk/) domain, Twitter/X [@nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk), ENS [nounsmk.eth](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth%3A0x144975eEc9674fd0Af3d6F3FBa8D660879cE3881), and nounsmkdao.eth for marketing.
- Updated budget and design constraints from previous proposal attempts.
