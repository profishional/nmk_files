[Real design will be done by a top-tier designer once he can start on the project]

---

### Revisions from [#266](https://nouns.wtf/vote/266):
- USDC denomination throughout the proposal and budget. Approximately 35% budget reduction by changing manufacturing approach, reducing marketing and team budget.
- Primarily manufacturing a Keycap set with an optional full keyboard. Also separating MK DAO and Physical NFT experiments for the next iteration.
- Simplified overall plan, shortened text, better FAQ, and detailed costing spreadsheet linked below.

[**Positive feedback from the previous proposal**](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/266):
- Community Alignment: A shared belief that the mechanical keyboard and Nouns communities have synergies, both being passionate and vibrant.
- Artistic Value: Recognition that mechanical keyboards are not just tools but are viewed as curated works of art by enthusiasts.
- Detailed Proposal: Depth and informativeness of the proposal including the visual concepts. Also, confidence in the team's ability given their experiences.

---

### TL;DR:
- Nouns-themed keycap set by a top-tier designer (not just glasses seen in the illustration) to introduce Nouns to an enthusiastic subculture of gamers, developers, collectors, and typists.
- 75K for Approx. 700 keycap sets or 275 full keyboards (keycap set + case), or a combination between those two limits. With 3 tiers of Artisan keycaps for marketing and low entry points.
- The grant covers all of the costs and Nouners mint for free. Profit from non-Noun holders goes to the project treasury until they can afford to buy a Noun and participate in governance.

### Intro
As one of the primary means of interacting with our online world, keyboards are more than just a tool – they've become a piece of personal expression. Let's design a keyboard a Nouns-themed Mechanical Keyboard (MK) that the community appreciates! NextMech and I are excited to bring this project to Nouns in collaboration with top-tier keyboard designers. With our internal MK knowledge and technical ability we plan to introduce the MK community to Nouns.

### Overview
Over the years, [an online subculture (reflected in partial MK ecosystem stats)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) has evolved, valuing custom keyboards as art pieces. This MK enthusiast community operates similarly to NFT communities. For instance, designers unveil their plans to collectors, who pre-order to finance manufacturing costs. The communities, decentralized across various platforms and websites, foster a rich dialogue between designers and fans. [They even organize global meetups](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query). There's potential to gradually unify these communities to enhance the experiences.

The community activity and other meetups can be seen by searching for ["mechanical keyboard meet"](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X or searching "[custom keyboard](https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=custom%20keyboards)” on Instagram. This culture also extends into the gaming/work setups online.

Also, looking at the r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit we see the community is slowly growing over time:

[Here is a small data set that we have gathered on the ecosystem to provide more context.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing)

### Us
NextMech and I (profish) began working on a project called Mechies last year which won a small prize in an Aussie hackathon. We thought about MK NFTs in different forms such as generative art with manufacturable traits, DAOs as Vendors for group buys, hardware-embedded signatures, etc., to help improve the ecosystem. But at the beginning of the year, we learned about Nouns and saw the potential for consumer-good NFTs. So we thought it would be interesting to run this experiment with the most vibrant NFT community.

We devised a proposal in April ([prop #266](https://nouns.wtf/vote/266)) with an ambitious plan. We listened to the feedback and created this revision. However, due to the uncertainty surrounding the fork, we delayed the initiative to observe the outcome and find a better time for our own schedules.

### Nouns x MKs
The proliferation can take immediate effect with current channels. For instance, the Nouns Esports team can incorporate keycaps into their gaming setup (without affecting functionality), showcasing to the gaming spectators. Nouns keycaps may serve as POAPs for crypto conference and hackathon participants, while the full Nouns keyboards are taken to global meetups. Furthermore, images of these keyboards and keycaps will appear on popular online forums and social media accounts of MK enthusiasts - the design is not going to be as blatant as the one you see, but rather more aesthetic and nuanced in appearance. Also, we plan to work with MK builders and reviewers who have hundreds of thousands, even millions of followers to showcase the MK and tell the Nouns DAO story.

### **Summary Plan**
Here is a simple cost breakdown. A more detailed breakdown is below:
* 75K to manufacture approximately 700 keycap sets, OR a maximum of 275 full keyboards OR some combination of the two depending on demand, while still meeting Minimum Order Quantity.
* 15K for assembling, packaging, storage, and decent-quality shipping.
* 29K for digital marketing and artisan keycap including low, medium, and high tiers.
* 35K for the team, MK designer, website, and fulfillment.

## **Total - 154K USD**

## FAQs
- **What will the design be?** NOT THE ONE YOU SEE. That is just to spark the imagination, the designer will come up with something much more aesthetic and subtle once we go through the brief.
- **Who is the designer?** They are one of the mentioned people below. Due to their high profile status in the MK community, they don't want to reveal their name until they see the support from Nouns and can begin working on it. I can assure you he is one of the best out there for this project.
- **Who is going to buy this?** Ideally NOT people in crypto. The point isn’t to sell it to Nouns holders, it's to distribute it to the MK community and proliferate the idea. That's also why we are working with a designer that the MK community respects.
- **How much are the NFTs?** Approximately $120-130 USD for the keycap set and $350-380 USD for the full keyboard option. Noun holders can purchase for free (within the budgeted units in the grant) while non-Noun holders will pay full price. We aim to distribute these on popular vendor platforms to maximize reach!
- **How does the redemption work?** Once you redeem, the NFT becomes non-transferable. Because sharing pictures of the keyboard is important and having an NFT is even better.
- **How are you going to sell to noncrypto people?** We aim to work with traditional distribution channels such as marketplaces and communities to reach the MK community. We are exploring solutions for wallet creation for the consumer at the purchase stage.
- **Why is it so expensive?** Custom mechanical keyboards by top-tier designers, with good quality switches, cases, and components can go around $500 USD. Given the interested designer and other components, this is a reasonable price.
- **How many units?** The free units for Noun holders would be Approximately 700 keycaps or 275 full keyboards or a combination that totals a maximum of 75k worth of manufacturing. We plan to sell more units for a profit to non-Nouns holders.
- **Will the keyboards be assembled?** We have an assembled and un-assembled option for the minters since for some collectors assembling is part of the custom MK experience.
- **How long does it take to deliver?** Design could be done quickly but we want to give the designer 4-6 weeks. Manufacturing takes about 6-7 months. Delivery should take 2-4 weeks. So about 8 months, but assuming unforeseen challenges we are accounting for 9-10 months from the time funds have been received.
- **What happens to the grant and mint profits?** The grant helps meet the Minimum Order Quantity for manufacturing which wouldn’t be possible otherwise. The profits from the non-Nouns holders go to the team which we expect to be less than 20K USD.
- **Will anything be returned to the Nouns DAO?** Because we are MK enthusiasts we simply want this to become a reality, so we have made the team portion of the grant very modest relative to the work it takes. But we are committed to using some of the profits to buy a Noun and participate in the community - this also incentivized Nouns to help the success of the project. We don’t think it’s Nounish to be underpaid, make direct payments to the DAO, and leave.
- **How big is the MK community?** The forums and discord servers of designers are similar to or, bigger in size and activity compared to crypto communities. It is pretty scattered online, but I have made a [spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) to provide some context.
- **How will the project continue besides a one-off product?** We will plan an extension if this grant proves to be successful. It would involve creating a subDAO and experimenting with various products.

## Detailed Plan
Custom keyboard manufacturing involves two main components: the case and the keycap set. Switches and other components are also significant, but they are less customizable; therefore, we will simply use ones considered enthusiast grade. For a more detailed overview of mechanical keyboards, [check out this intro made by NextMech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing).

**Design -** To start, we will incorporate the Nouns brand into the keyboard canvas. We have talked to several designers who can create an aesthetic Noun-themed keyboard. These include [BIIP](https://instagram.com/biipmk), [NoPunIn10Did](https://nopunin10did.com/kat-napoleonic/), [sourmk](https://www.instagram.com/sourmk), pikku-allu, dededecline who would be able to capture the essence of the Nouns in a design. Also, a design by a top artist plays a major role in introducing Nouns to the MK community, ensuring a high-quality product that enthusiasts will enjoy. Here are some examples by the mentioned designers:

**Manufacturing -** We will work with a manufacturer with double-shot ABS capability to be able to make high-quality keycaps. However, if the creative direction requires a custom font we may trade off double-shot quality for printing flexibility. As for the case, we will be using an available unit from existing manufacturer catalogs that matches the keycaps set. The remaining components will be wholesale units that are considered enthusiast-grade quality. 

**The NFT -** will include the custom design once the prototypes are finalized. Mint of keycaps will be priced at approximately $120-130 USD, while the full keyboard (including the keycaps) will be $350-380 USD. It will have boolean-based redemption on [nouns.mk](https://nouns.mk/) since we don't want to burn the NFT and instead share it online. We also aim to work with traditional distributors to be able to reach the MK community.

**Marketing -** Prior to, and during the minting of the Keyboard NFTs, we will launch digital and physical marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the project. The physical marketing is in the style of MK communities. We are considering 3 different types of artisan keycaps. The keycaps are, Resin filled 3D keycaps that could have Nouns characters or traits inside, high-quality metallic keycaps, and Plastic keycaps with Nouns related graphics that can be given away for free at crypto conferences and MK events, or for a low cost online.

Here are examples of existing Resin and metallic keycaps by artisans. They will be designed and produced in a Nouns related theme. These caps can be a great addition to the custom keyboard, or they allow MK enthusiasts to add it to their existing keyboards.

![metal_caps](https://github.com/profishional/nmk_files/blob/main/metal_cal.jpeg?raw=true)

**Delivery -** Once manufacturing, assembly, and quality tests are complete, the NFTs can be redeemed. They will be stored with a distributor or manufacturer and can be redeemed at any time. It is possible to sell the NFTs prior to redeeming them with a 5% royalty fee.

### **Current Progress**
We will keep up-to-date information and progress on our Notions page. Here are some highlights from the current progress:
- Determined feasible manufacturers for case and keycaps.
- Discussing terms with keycap set designer and singular keycap manufacturers.
- Registered [Nouns.mk](http://nouns.mk/) domain, Twitter/X [@nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk), ENS [nounsmk.eth](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth%3A0x144975eEc9674fd0Af3d6F3FBa8D660879cE3881), and nounsmkdao.eth for marketing.
- Updated budget and design constraints from previous proposal attempts.
